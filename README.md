# Apptainer-Container-for-HADDOCK3-MPI-Ready-
This repository provides everything to build, run, and extend an Apptainer container for HADDOCK3 with MPI support. Apptainer (formerly Singularity) is a container platform tailored for HPC environments — it enables reproducible, portable, and secure deployments without requiring root privileges, making it ideal for scientific workflows on clusters. The biggest advantage of Apptainer is that it seamlessly integrates with shared HPC filesystems and scheduler systems (e.g., SLURM, PBS) while preserving user permissions and security. HADDOCK3 is the latest version of the HADDOCK (High Ambiguity Driven protein–protein Docking) platform, a flexible, information-driven docking software suite for modeling biomolecular complexes using experimental and theoretical restraints. The container is fully backward-compatible with Singularity, so you can build and use the same definition file with either tool. Alongside HADDOCK3 itself, the container bundles essential editors, monitoring tools, file-sync utilities, and interactive environments (classic Jupyter Notebook & JupyterLab), plus utility scripts and example workflows. You can easily customize the definition to include additional utilities or domain-specific tools when building your container image.
